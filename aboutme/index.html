<!-- My name -->
<h1>Martina Currenti</h1>

<!-- My studies -->
<h4>Media, Journalism and Publishing <br> student at Oxford Brookes
</h4>

<!-- Description -->
<h3> Hello there! </h3>

<h3> I'm Marty, and I am the mind behind Pretty in Font. </h3>
<h3> This website was born as a project for my Typographic design for Page and Screen, and it unites my passion for romantic comedies, and the fact that I needed to find a good and interesting topic in order to get a decent mark in this module. </h3>
<h3> Jokes aside, I am really enjoying working on this blog, as it allows me to practice my writing skills. I would really love to become a published author in the future, but for now I aspire to finish university and find a job as either a journalist or a publisher/editor – I haven't made up my mind yet, and I do not really mind working in either industry. I guess that one of the perks of doing a varied degree is that I have more options to choose from. </h3>
<h3> However, I do know one thing for sure: that I have always loved writing, and that "when i grow up", I want to become a storyteller – it doesn't matter if the stories I get to share are real or fictional.
<!-- List section -->
<p>Here's three fun facts <br> things about me:</p>

<!-- Proper list -->
<ol>
  1- My favourite movies of all times belong to the original Jurassic Park trilogy. No romantic comedies? Shocking, I know! Nevertheless, they are movies from my childhood, so they will always have a special spot in my heart; <br> <br>

2- I love cappuccinos! I would drink them all the time: for breakfast, for dinner, even as a midnight snack! Some may say that I'm obsessed with them, and I guess they are right; <br> <br>

3- If I could change anything about myself, it would be my lactose intolerance.
