<!-- My name -->
<h1>Martina Currenti</h1>

<!-- My studies -->
<h4>Media, Journalism and Publishing <br> student at Oxford Brookes
</h4>

<!-- Description -->
<h3> Hello there! </h3>

<h3> I'm Marty, and I am the mind behind <span class="highlight1">Pretty in Font. </span> </h3>
<h3> This website was born as a project for my Typographic design for Page and Screen, and it unites my passion for romantic comedies, and the fact that I needed to find a good and interesting topic in order to get a decent mark in this module. </h3>
<h3> Jokes aside, I am really enjoying working on this blog, as it allows me to practice my writing skills. I would really love to become a published author in the future, but for now I aspire to finish university and find a job as either in journalism or in publishing – I haven't made up my mind yet, and I do not really mind working in either industry. I guess that one of the perks of doing a varied degree is that I have more options to choose from. Ideally speaking, <span class="highlight5">of course.</span> </h3>
<h3> However, I do know one thing for sure: that I have always loved writing, and that "when i grow up", I want to become a <span class="highlight1">storyteller </span> – it doesn't matter if the stories I get to share are real or fictional. </h3>

<p>About my <span class="highlight5">(terrific)</span> works:</p>

<h3> As I have been writing since I was around a 9 y.o. kiddo, I have <span class="highlight5">plenty</span> of pieces that I could put in my portfolio, from the fanfictions about my alter ego in the Harry Potter universe, to some recent articles. </h3>
<h3> I'll present you my amazing fanfictions perhaps another time, because I don't want the Government to find out about them and ostracise me. </h3>
<h3> <span class="highlight1"> Now let's talk about business. </span> Since the middle of the pandemic, some of my classmates and I have been working on a news project called <span class="highlight1"> Exist News</span>, where we have posted our articles about current, general, and pop culture related news. You can read my works at <span class="highlight3"><a href="https://existnewsmedia.wordpress.com/"> this</a></span>link.</h3>
<h3> Shares, likes, and comments are <span class="highlight1">highly </span> appreciated! :) </h3>

<h3> I also try to write novels when my deadlines are close and I should really work on my assignments, however I never go past the first two chapters. Perhaps one day I will... For now, <span class="highlight5">boohoo me</span>, I guess.
<!-- List section -->
<p>Here's three fun facts <br> things about me:</p>

<!-- Proper list -->
<ol>
  <span class="highlight">1 - </span> My favourite movies of all times belong to the original Jurassic Park trilogy. No romantic comedies? Shocking, I know! <span class="highlight5">Nevertheless</span>, they are movies from my childhood, so they will always have a special spot in my heart; <br> <br>

<span class="highlight">2 - </span>I love cappuccinos! I would drink them <span class="highlight5">all the time</span>: for breakfast, for dinner, even as a midnight snack! Some may say that I'm obsessed with them, and I guess they are right; <br> <br>

<span class="highlight">3 - </span> If I could change <span class="highlight5">anything</span> about myself, it would be my lactose intolerance.
</ol>
