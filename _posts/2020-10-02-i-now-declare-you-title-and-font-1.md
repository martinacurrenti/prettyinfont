There is just one thing that can come between two people who have grew up together, whose bond is as long lasting as the old Nintendo DS that lays forgotten in one of your desk's drawers â€“ and that is a wedding in June at *the* Plaza. Pretty specific, don't you think? Except for the fact that it really did happen, in fiction of course, to the two protagonists of one of the most famous romantic comedies about weddings: **Bride Wars**.
